        "\n",
        "### Objective\n",
        "We‚Äôll walk through an end-to-end workflow for designing peptides that bind to the cancer-related protein MDM2.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Learning Goals\n",
        "*    Understand how to evaluate a protein as a binding target.\n",
        "*    Generate novel peptide candidates with modern AI methods.\n",
        "*    Predict and evaluate peptide‚Äìprotein binding with Boltz-2.\n",
        "*    Rank candidates based on structural confidence metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "## üß¨MDM2 as a Protein Target\n",
        "The MDM2 protein (Mouse Double Minute 2 homolog) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a central role in regulating the tumor suppressor p53. Under normal conditions, MDM2 binds to p53 and tags it for degradation, keeping p53 levels low.\n",
        "\n",
        "This interaction is crucial because p53 acts as a ‚Äúguardian of the genome‚Äù, triggering DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis in response to stress or DNA damage. When MDM2 binds and inhibits p53 too strongly, it can silence this defense mechanism, which is one reason MDM2 is often overexpressed in cancers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model System**\n",
        "\n",
        "The p53‚ÄìMDM2 interaction is well studied and one of the most famous examples of a peptide‚Äìprotein interaction in cancer biology.\n",
        "*   MDM2 regulates p53, which controls cell cycle and apoptosis.\n",
        "*   Overactive MDM2 suppresses p53 ‚Üí linked to cancer.\n",
        "*   MDM2 binds a short peptide from p53 (residues 17‚Äì29) in a clearly defined hydrophobic pocket.\n",
        "\n",
        "The MDM2 binding domain is relatively small (~110 amino acids), making it computationally manageable for a short workshop!\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many experimental structures available (e.g. PDB: 1YCR), providing reliable references for validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Forget most of that!**\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll assume that no experimental structures exist and that the binding pocket is unknown.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will work with three assumptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "&bull; We want to target this protein because it's suspected to bind to p53 peptide.\n",
        "&bull; We have a UniProt ID for this protein: Q00987.\n",
        "&bull; UniProt will inform us which domains are necessary for the p53 interaction.\n",
